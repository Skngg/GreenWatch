# Overview
Prototype of an IoT sensor kit for greenhouses or similar gardening facilities. The system is based on the Azure Sphere MT3620 Starter Kit.

Features of the system will include:

* Data acquisition from temperature, pressure and ambient light sensors
* Diagnostics and configuration via UART - i.a. constant readings trasmit to debug UART, log size and data logging frequency
* System may include additional features developed in future - e.g. cloud-data storage and data analysis using MS Azure platfrom
